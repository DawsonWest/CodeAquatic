# CodeAquatic
For my Code Louisville project I am designing a website based on the insanely awesome (and admittedly flawed) film The Life Aquatic.  The movie is about an oceanography group that is towards the end of their careers and fame.  The site will include short bios for each team member as well as information on their adventures.
